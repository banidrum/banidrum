I'm a back-end developer and an undergraduate Computer Science student. At the moment I'm working with microservices using the following stack: Node.js, Typescript, Nest.js, Express, Docker and Kubernetes. 

I'm currently studying AWS and Golang. I have a growing interest in platform engineering and infrastructure. 

My interests right now are cloud computing and distributed systems.
