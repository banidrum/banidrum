I'm a back-end developer and an undergraduate Computer Science student. At the moment I'm working with microservices using the following stack: Node.js, Typescript, Nest.js, Express, Docker and Kubernetes.

I'm currently studying AWS and Golang.

My interests right now are basically cloud computing and distributed systems.

I have plans to study computer vision and machine learning in a not so distant future.

I guess that's it for now! ðŸ˜‹
